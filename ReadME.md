# AutoPyTypes

## Intoduction
This package is designed to implement typing into any python code and help you get your code to next level.
Types become industry standard and therefore languages that can adapt typing mechanism are to be more reliable.
Python originally built with dynamic type system that allows variables change types along the code, this 
methodology has some advantages but when it comes to build and maintain large-scale and multi-component 
software system without types it could become a living hell.
today python 3 is offering new type systems that helps the developers assign variables into types in runtime.

With the power of ChatGPT we are now able to transform any python code without type hinting to a fully documented 
type-hint code.
